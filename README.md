Code for the Autonomous Car for Embedded Systems Programming (CSCI 4287)

The code used in the final demonstration of the car is located in final_car_code.ino.
All other files were used as we were testing the car, but are not dependencies of final_car_code.ino.

The code is intended to be uploaded to an Arudino UNO with the following hardware attached:
- Motor shield
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- 2 Laser Range sensors
- 2 actuators (motors for the wheels)
